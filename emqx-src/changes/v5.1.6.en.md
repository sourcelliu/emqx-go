## Enhancements

- [#11429](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11429) Added option to configure detection of legacy protocol in MondoDB connectors and bridges.

- [#11436](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11436) Added a new API endpoint `DELETE  /banned` to clear all `banned` data.

- [#11438](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11438) Changed the type of the `mqtt.max_packet_size` from string to byteSize to better represent the valid numeric range.
  Strings will still be accepted for backwards compatibility.

- [#11424](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11424) Added a check for the maximum value of the timestamp in the API to ensure it is a valid Unix timestamp.

- [#11445](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11445) Removed os_mon application monitor support on Windows platforms to prevent VM crashes.
  Functionality remains on non-Windows platforms.

- [#11456](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11456) Removed validation that enforced non-empty PEM for CA cert file.
