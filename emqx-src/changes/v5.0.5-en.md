# v5.0.5

## Enhancements

* Add `bootstrap_users_file` configuration to add default Dashboard username list, which is only added when EMQX is first started.
* The license is now copied to all nodes in the cluster when it's reloaded. [#8598](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8598)
* Added a HTTP API to manage licenses. [#8610](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8610)
* Updated `/nodes` API node_status from `Running/Stopped` to `running/stopped`. [#8642](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8642)
* Improve handling of placeholder interpolation errors [#8635](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8635)
* Better logging on unknown object IDs. [#8670](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8670)
* The bind option support `:1883` style. [#8758](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8758)

## Bug fixes

* Allow changing the license type from key to file (and vice-versa). [#8598](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8598)
* Add back http connector config keys `max_retries` `retry_interval` as deprecated fields [#8672](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/issues/8672)
  This caused upgrade failure in 5.0.4, because it would fail to boot on configs created from older version.
