# v5.0.10

## Enhancements

- Improve `/nodes` API responsiveness [#9221](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9221).

- Improve the integration of the `banned` and the `delayed` feature [#9326](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9326).
  Now when publishing a delayed message will check first if its source client is banned, if true, this publish will be ignored.

- Update `gen_rpc` library to version 3.0 [#9187](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9187).

- Improve memory usage on core nodes when bootstrapping a replicant [#9236](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9236).

- Improve stability of Prometheus Push Gateway and log errors when POST fails [#9235](http://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9235).

- Now it is possible to opt out VM internal metrics in prometheus stats [#9222](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9222).
  When system load is high, reporting too much metrics data may cause the prometheus stats API timeout.

- Improve security when converting types such as `binary` `lists` to `atom` types [#9279](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9279), [#9286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9286).

- Add `/trace/:name/log_detail` HTTP API to return trace file's size and mtime [#9152](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9152).

- Add `/status` HTTP API endpoint to api documentation [#9230](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9230).

- Binary packages for all platforms are now built on Erlang/OTP version 24.3.4.2 [#9293](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9293).

- Added more `client.disconnected` events (and counter bumps) [#9327](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9327).
  Prior to this change, the `client.disconnected` event (and counter bump) is triggered when a client
  performs a 'normal' disconnect, or is 'kicked' by system admin, but NOT triggered when a
  stale connection had to be 'discarded' (for clean session) or 'takeovered' (for non-clean session) by new connection.

## Bug fixes

- Fix error log message when `mechanism` is missing in authentication config [#8924](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8924).

- Fix HTTP 500 issue when unknown `status` parameter is used in `/gateway` API call [#9225](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9225).

- Fixed the HTTP response status code for the `/status` endpoint [#9211](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9211).
  Before the fix, it always returned `200` even if the EMQX application was not running. Now it returns `503` in that case.

- Fix message delivery related event encoding [#9228](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9228).
  This bug was introduced in v5.0.9. For Rule-Engine's input events like `$events/message_delivered`
  and `$events/message_dropped`, if the message was delivered to a shared-subscription,
  the encoding (to JSON) of the event will fail.

- Fix bad HTTP response status code for `/gateways` API, when Gateway name is unknown, it should return `404` instead of `400` [#9268](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9268).

- Fix incorrect topic authorize checking of delayed messages [#9290](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9290).
  Now will determine the actual topic of the delayed messages, e.g. `$delayed/1/t/foo` will be treated as `t/foo` in authorize checks.

- Add property `code` to error response for `/authentication/sources/:type` [9299](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9299).

- Align documentation for `/authentication/sources` with what we actually send [9299](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9299).

- Fix query string parameter 'node' to `/configs` resource being ignored, return 404 if node does not exist [#9310](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9310/).

- Avoid re-dispatching shared-subscription session messages when a session is kicked or taken-over (to a new session) [#9123](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9123).
