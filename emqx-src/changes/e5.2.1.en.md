## Enhancements

- [#11487](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11487) The bcrypt work factor is limited to the range 5-10, because higher values consume too much CPU resources.
  Bcrypt library is updated to allow parallel hash evaluation.

- [#11532](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11532) Improve some error reasons when parsing invalid packets.

- [#11568](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11568) Added support for defining templates for MQTT 5.0 publish properties and user properties in Republish rule action.

## Bug Fixes

- [#11493](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11493) Examples and documentation for /api/v5/publish bad request response have been fixed. Previously the documentation example said that the bad request response could return a list in the body which was not actually the case.

- [#11499](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11499) Upgrade Erlang/OTP to 25.3.2-2

  Erlang/OTP 25.3.2-2 excludes sensitive data from mnesia_hook log message.

- [#11506](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11506) Don't download a trace log file if it is empty.

  After this fix, GET `/api/v5/trace/clientempty/download` returns 404 `{"code":"NOT_FOUND","message":"Trace is empty"}`
  If no events matching the trace condition occurred.

- [#11522](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11522) Improved error message for rule engine schema registry when schema name exceeds permissible length.

- [#11531](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11531) Fixed issue where authorization cache cleaning cli was not working properly for specific client ID.

- [#11394](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11394) Upgrade Kafka producer client `wolff` from 1.7.6 to 1.7.7.
  This fixes a potential race condition which may cause all Kafka producers to crash if some failed to initialize.

- [#11401](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11401) When running one of the rule engine SQL `mongo_date` functions in the EMQX dashboard test interface, the resulting date is formatted as `ISODate(*)`, where * is the date in ISO date format instead of only the ISO date string. This is the format used by MongoDB to store dates.

- [#11547](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11547) Fix several emqx_bridge issues:

  - fix Cassandra bridge connect error occurring when the bridge is configured without username/password
  (Cassandra doesn't require user credentials when it is configured with `authenticator: AllowAllAuthenticator`)
  - fix SQL Server bridge connect error caused by an empty password
  - make `username` a required field in Oracle bridge
  - fix IoTDB bridge error caused by setting base URL without scheme (e.g. `<host>:<port>`)
