## Bug Fixes

- [#10009](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10009) Validate `bytes` param to `GET /trace/:name/log` to not exceed signed 32bit integer.

- [#10015](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10015) To prevent errors caused by an incorrect EMQX node cookie provided from an environment variable,
  we have implemented a fail-fast mechanism.
  Previously, when an incorrect cookie was provided, the command would still attempt to ping the node,
  leading to the error message 'Node xxx not responding to pings'.
  With the new implementation, if a mismatched cookie is detected,
  a message will be logged to indicate that the cookie is incorrect,
  and the command will terminate with an error code of 1 without trying to ping the node.

- [#10020](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10020) Fix bridge metrics when running in async mode with batching enabled (`batch_size` > 1).

- [#10021](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10021) Fix error message when the target node of `emqx_ctl cluster join` command is not running.

- [#9939](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9939) Allow 'emqx ctl cluster' command to be issued before Mnesia starts.
  Prior to this change, EMQX `replicant` could not use `manual` discovery strategy.
  Now it's possible to join cluster using 'manual' strategy.

- [#9958](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9958) Fix bad http response format when client ID is not found in `clients` APIs

- [#9961](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9961) Avoid parsing config files for node name and cookie when executing non-boot commands in bin/emqx.

- [#9974](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9974) Report memory usage to statsd and prometheus using the same data source as dashboard.
  Prior to this fix, the memory usage data source was collected from an outdated source which did not work well in containers.

- [#9978](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9978) Fixed configuration issue when choosing to use SSL for a Postgres connection (`authn`, `authz` and bridge).
  The connection could fail to complete with a previously working configuration after an upgrade from 5.0.13 to newer EMQX versions.

- [#9997](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9997) Fix Swagger API schema generation. `deprecated` metadata field is now always boolean, as [Swagger specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) suggests.
