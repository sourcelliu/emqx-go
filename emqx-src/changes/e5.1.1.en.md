- [#11115](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11115) Added info logs to indicate when buffered messages are dropped due to time-to-live (TTL) expiration.
- [#11133](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11133) Renamed `deliver_rate` to `delivery_rate` in the configuration of `retainer`, while being compatible with the previous `deliver_rate`.
- [#11137](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11137) Refactored the Dashboard listener configuration to use a nested `ssl_options` field for SSL settings.
- [#11138](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11138) Changed the default value of k8s `api_server` from `http://127.0.0.1:9091` to `https://kubernetes.default.svc:443`.
  - `emqx_ctl conf show cluster` no longer displays irrelevant configuration items when `discovery_strategy=static`.
  Configuration information related to `etcd/k8s/dns` will not be shown.
  - Removed `zones `(deprecated config key) from `emqx_ctl conf show_keys`.
- [#11165](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11165) Removed the `/configs/limiter` API from `swagger.json`. Only the API documentation was removed,
  and the `/configs/limiter` API functionalities remain unchanged.
- [#11166](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11166) Added 3 random SQL functions to the rule engine:
  - `random()`: Generates a random number between 0 and 1 (0.0 =< X < 1.0).
  - `uuid_v4()`: Generates a random UUID (version 4) string.
  - `uuid_v4_no_hyphen()`: Generates a random UUID (version 4) string without hyphens.
- [#11180](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11180) Added a new configuration API `/configs` (GET/PUT) that supports reloading the HOCON format configuration file.
- [#11226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11226) Unified the listener switch to `enable`, while being compatible with the previous `enabled`.
- [#11249](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11249) Added `/license/setting` REST API endpoint to read and update licensed connections usage alarm watermark.
- [#11251](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11251) Added the `/cluster/topology` REST API endpoint:
  A `GET` request to this endpoint returns the cluster topology, showing connections between RLOG core and replicant nodes.
- [#11253](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11253) The Webhook/HTTP bridge has been refactored into its own Erlang application. This allows for more flexibility in the future and allows the bridge to be run as a standalone application.
- [#11079](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11079) Added support for custom headers in messages for Kafka bridge producer mode.
- [#11132](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11132) Added support for MQTT action authorization based on QoS level and Retain flag values.

- [#11207](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11207) Updated the driver versions of multiple data bridges to enhance security and ensure that sensitive data will not be leaked. This includes:
  - TDengine
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - Clickhouse
- [#11241](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11241) Schema Registry has been refactored into its own Erlang application. This allows for more flexibility in the future.

## Bug Fixes

- [#11004](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11004) Wildcards are no longer allowed for the destination topic in topic rewrite.
- [#11026](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11026) Addressed an inconsistency in the usage of `div` and `mod` operations within the rule engine. Previously, the `div'` operation could only be used as an infix operation, and `mod` could only be applied through a function call. Now, both `div` and `mod` can be used via function call syntax and infix syntax.
- [#11037](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11037) When starting an HTTP connector, EMQX now returns a descriptive error in case the system is unable to connect to the remote target system.
- [#11039](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11039) Fixed database number validation for Redis connector. Previously, negative numbers were accepted as valid database numbers.
- [#11074](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11074) Fixed a bug to adhere to Protocol spec MQTT-5.0 [MQTT-3.8.3-4].
- [#11077](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11077) Fixed a crash when updating listener binding with a non-integer port.
- [#11094](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11094) Fixed an issue where connection errors in Kafka Producer would not be reported when reconnecting the bridge.
- [#11103](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11103) Updated `erlcloud` dependency.
- [#11106](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11106) Added validation for the maximum number of `worker_pool_size` of a bridge resource.
  Now the maximum amount is 1024 to avoid large memory consumption from an unreasonable number of workers.
- [#11118](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11118) Ensured that validation errors in REST API responses are slightly less confusing. Now, if there are out-of-range errors, they will be presented as `{"value": 42, "reason": {"expected": "1..10"}, ...}`, replacing the previous usage of `expected_type` with `expected`.
- [#11126](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11126) Rule metrics for async mode bridges will set failure counters correctly now.
- [#11134](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11134) Fixed the value of the uppercase `authorization` header not being obfuscated in the log.
- [#11139](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11139) The Redis connector has been refactored into its own Erlang application to improve the code structure.
- [#11145](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11145) Added several fixes and improvements in Ekka and Mria.
  Ekka:
  - Improved cluster discovery log messages to consistently describe actual events
  [Ekka PR](https://github.com/emqx/ekka/pull/204).
  - Removed deprecated cluster auto-clean configuration parameter (it has been moved to Mria)
  [Ekka PR](https://github.com/emqx/ekka/pull/203).
  Mria:
  - Ping now only runs on replicant nodes. Previously, `mria_lb` was trying to ping both stopped and running
  replicant nodes, which could result in timeout errors.
  [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/146)
  - Used `null_copies` storage when copying `$mria_rlog_sync` table.
  This fix has no effect on EMQX for now, as `$mria_rlog_sync` is only used in `mria:sync_transaction/2,3,4`,
  which is not utilized by EMQX.
  [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/144)
- [#11148](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11148) Fixed an issue when nodes tried to synchronize configuration update operations to a node which has already left the cluster.
- [#11150](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11150) Wait for Mria table when emqx_psk app is being started to ensure that PSK data is synced to replicant nodes even if they don't have init PSK file.
- [#11151](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11151) The MySQL connector has been refactored into its own Erlang application to improve the code structure.
- [#11158](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11158) Wait for Mria table when the mnesia backend of retainer starts to avoid a possible error of the retainer when joining a cluster.
- [#11162](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11162) Fixed an issue in webhook bridge where, in async query mode, HTTP status codes like 4XX and 5XX would be treated as successes in the bridge metrics.
- [#11164](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11164) Reintroduced support for nested (i.e.: `${payload.a.b.c}`) placeholders for extracting data from rule action messages without the need for calling `json_decode(payload)` first.
- [#11172](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11172) Fixed the `payload` field in rule engine SQL being duplicated in the below situations:
  - When using a `foreach` sentence without the `as` sub-expression and selecting all fields (using the `*` or omitting the `do` sub-expression).
  For example:
  `FOREACH payload.sensors FROM "t/#"`
  - When selecting the `payload` field and all fields.
  For example:
  `SELECT payload.sensors, * FROM "t/#"`
- [#11174](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11174) Fixed the encoding of the `server` key coming from an ingress MQTT bridge.
  Before the fix, it was encoded as a list of integers corresponding to the ASCII characters of the server string.

- [#11229](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11229) Fixed an issue that prevented plugins from starting/stopping after changing configuration via `emqx ctl conf load`.
- [#11237](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11237) The `headers` default value in /prometheus API should be a map instead of a list.
- [#11250](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11250) Fixed a bug when the order of MQTT packets withing a WebSocket packet will be reversed.
- [#11271](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11271) Ensured that the range of all percentage type configurations is from 0% to 100% in the REST API and configuration. For example, `sysom.os.sysmem_high_watermark=101%` is invalid now.
- [#11272](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11272) Fixed a typo in the log, where an abnormal `PUBREL` packet was mistakenly referred to as `pubrec`.
- [#11281](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11281) Restored support for the special `$queue/` shared subscription topic prefix.
- [#11294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11294) Fixed `emqx ctl cluster join`, `leave`, and `status` commands.
- [#11306](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11306) Fixed rule action metrics inconsistency where dropped requests were not accounted for.
- [#11309](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11309) Improved startup order of EMQX applications. Simplified build scripts and improved code reuse.
- [#11322](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11322) Added support for importing additional configurations from EMQX backup file (`emqx ctl import` command):
  - rule_engine (previously not imported due to the bug)
  - topic_metrics (previously not implemented)
  - slow_subs (previously not implemented).
- [#10645](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10645) Changed health check for Oracle Database, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Kafka Producer data bridges to ensure target table/topic exists.
- [#11107](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11107) MongoDB bridge health check now returns the failure reason.
- [#11139](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11139) The Redis bridge has been refactored into its own Erlang application to improve the code structure and to make it easier to maintain.
- [#11151](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11151) The MySQL bridge has been refactored into its own Erlang application to improve the code structure and to make it easier to maintain.
- [#11163](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11163) Hid `topology.pool_size` in MondoDB bridges and fixed it to 1 to avoid confusion.
- [#11175](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11175) Now when using a nonexistent hostname for connecting to MySQL, a 400 error is returned rather than 503 in the REST API.
- [#11198](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11198) Fixed global rebalance status evaluation on replicant nodes. Previously, `/api/v5/load_rebalance/global_status` API method could return incomplete results if handled by a replicant node.
- [#11223](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11223) In InfluxDB bridging, mixing decimals and integers in a field may lead to serialization failure in the Influx Line Protocol, resulting in the inability to write to the InfluxDB bridge (when the decimal point is 0, InfluxDB mistakenly interprets it as an integer).
  See also: [InfluxDB v2.7 Line-Protocol](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.7/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#float).
- [#11225](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11225) The `username` field in PostgreSQL/Timescale/MatrixDB bridges configuration is now a required one.
- [#11242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11242) Restarted emqx_ee_schema_registry when a node joins a cluster. As emqx_ee_schema_registry uses Mria tables, a node joining a cluster needs to restart this application in order to start relevant Mria shard processes, ensuring a correct behaviour in Core/Replicant mode.
- [#11266](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11266) Fixed and improved support for TDengine `insert` syntax:
  1. Added support for inserting into multi-table in the template.
     For example:
     `insert into table_1 values (${ts}, '${id}', '${topic}')
     table_2 values (${ts}, '${id}', '${topic}')`
  2. Added support for mixing prefixes/suffixes and placeholders in the template.
     For example:
     `insert into table_${topic} values (${ts}, '${id}', '${topic}')`
     Note: This is a breaking change. Previously, the values of string type were quoted automatically, but now they must be quoted explicitly.
     For example:
     `insert into table values (${ts}, '${a_string}')`
- [#11307](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11307) Fixed check for table existence to return a more friendly message in the Oracle bridge.
- [#11316](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11316) Fixed Pool Size value not being considered in Oracle Bridge.
- [#11326](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11326) Fixed return error checking on table validation in the Oracle bridge.
