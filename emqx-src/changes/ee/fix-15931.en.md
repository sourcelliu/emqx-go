Occasionally, when starting a node, there could be some spurious but harmless logs such as:

```
2025-09-15T08:16:24.171777+00:00 [error] Generic event handler emqx_alarm_handler crashed. Installed: alarm_handler. Last event: {clear_alarm,lc_runq_alarm}. State: []. Reason: {aborted,{no_exists,[emqx_activated_alarm,runq_overload]}}.
```

This has been fixed.
