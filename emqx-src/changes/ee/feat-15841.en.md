Improved the refresh rate of the session count for namespaced sessions.  Now, when there are less than 1000 connections a given namespace, its count is updated on demand, otherwise, it's updated every 5 seconds.

During a rolling upgrade with versions prior to 6.0, the namespace session count will be inconsistent as we changed the internal tables that are used to track them.  As the upgrade progresses, clients connected to nodes running older versions will be disconnected and reconnect to new nodes, and the count shall eventually become consistent at the end of the upgrade when there are no longer old nodes.
