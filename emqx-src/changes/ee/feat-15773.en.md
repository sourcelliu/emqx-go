Throttle client ID registration during reconnects

Added throttling for client ID registration if the previous session cleanup is still in progress.
This prevents instability when clients reconnect aggressively with the same client ID.
Affected clients will receive reason code `137` (Server Busy) in `CONNACK` with Reason-String "THROTTLED".
Clients should retry after the previous session cleanup has completed.

Also fixed the reason code from `133` to `137` when there is another connection in the middle of registering the same client ID.
