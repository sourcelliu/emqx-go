Fixed an issue with Connectors where a pool of workers could fail to recover from a failure if multiple workers crashed simultaneously in large worker pools.

Connectors affected and fixed:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQLServer
- TDEngine
- Cassandra
- Dynamo
- HTTP
- Couchbase
- GCP PubSub
- Snowflake

Upgraded `gun` and related dependencies to 2.1.0.
