Implement automatic trace log rotation.

When a trace file size exceeds `trace.max_file_size`, EMQX no longer discards all subsequent events and emits an incomprehensible warning to stderr. Instead, portions of the oldest events are discarded while the most recent ones are retained.

As such, this also implies that:
* EMQX now maintains multiple trace log files per active trace. The layout of the trace directory has changed accordingly.
* Trace API has been updated to reflect this behavior. Log Stream API may now return additional errors: in particular, a stream can become stale if the consumer is too slow.

Additionally, Trace API now manages resources more carefully when handling large trace downloads.
