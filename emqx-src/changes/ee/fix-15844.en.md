Added validation to forbid adding empty usernames to the built-in database authenticator.  Such users cannot be deleted via the HTTP API later, since they mess up the API path.

If you have such an user and wish to delete it, run the following in an EMQX console:

```erlang
mria:transaction(emqx_authn_shard, fun() -> mnesia:delete(emqx_authn_mnesia, {'mqtt:global',<<>>}, write) end).
```
