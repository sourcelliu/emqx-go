Improve system memory usage.

- Authorization (authz) cache is now cleared immediately when a client disconnects, reducing unnecessary memory consumption.
- Fields such as client ID, username, password, and topic are copied into new binaries (when more than 64 bytes) instead of being slices from the raw packet to reduce 'binary' part of memory usage in Erlang VM.
