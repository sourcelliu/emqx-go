Lower default `active_n` value from `100` to `10`.

This change improves the responsiveness of MQTT clients to control signals, particularly when publishing at high rates with small messages.

The new `active_n` value of `10` is set deliberately lower than the default Receive-Maximum (`32`),
to introduce more push-back at the TCP layer in the following scenarios:

- The client process is blocked while performing external authorization checks.
- The client process is blocked during data integration message sends.
- The system is experiencing overload conditions.
