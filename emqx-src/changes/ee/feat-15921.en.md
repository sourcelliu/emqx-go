License alarm for cluster max TPS.

- Added a new license alarm that monitors the cluster’s maximum transactions per second (TPS).
- On each node, TPS is calculated as the average number of MQTT messages received + sent over the last 10 seconds.
- The cluster’s total TPS is aggregated every 5 seconds.
- If the observed TPS exceeds the licensed TPS limit, an alarm will be triggered.
- The alarm remains active until a new license with a higher TPS allowance is applied.
