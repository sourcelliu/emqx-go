# v5.0.1

5.0.1 is built on [Erlang/OTP 24.2.1-1](https://github.com/emqx/otp/tree/OTP-24.2.1-1). Same as 5.0.0.

5.0.0 (like 4.4.x) had Erlang/OTP version number in the package name.
This is because we wanted to release different flavor packages (on different Elixir/Erlang/OTP platforms).

However the long package names also causes confusion, as users may not know which to choose if there were more than
one presented at the same time.

Going forward, (starting from 5.0.1), packages will be released in both default (short) and flavored (long) package names.

For example: `emqx-5.0.1-otp24.2.1-1-ubuntu20.04-amd64.tar.gz`,
but only the default one is presented to the users: `emqx-5.0.1-ubuntu20.04-amd64.tar.gz`.

In case anyone wants to try a different flavor package, it can be downlowded from the public s3 bucket,
for example:
https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/packages.emqx/emqx-ce/v5.0.1/emqx-5.0.1-otp24.2.1-1-ubuntu20.04-arm64.tar.gz

Exceptions:

* Windows package is always presented with short name (currently on Erlang/OTP 24.2.1).
* Elixir package name is flavored with both Elixir and Erlang/OTP version numbers,
  for example: `emqx-5.0.1-elixir1.13.4-otp24.2.1-1-ubuntu20.04-amd64.tar.gz`
