# v5.0.19

## Bug Fixes

- [#10032](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10032) When the resource manager is busy trying to establish a connection with the remote, the resource might yet lack any metrics information. Prior to this fix, the `bridges/` API handler crashed in such circumstances.

- [#10037](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10037) Fix Swagger API doc rendering crash.
  In version 5.0.18, a bug was introduced that resulted in duplicated field names in the configuration schema. This, in turn, caused the Swagger schema generated to become invalid.

- [#10041](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10041) For influxdb bridge, added integer value placeholder annotation hint to `write_syntax` documentation.
  Also supported setting a constant value for the `timestamp` field.

- [#10042](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10042) Improve behavior of the `replicant` nodes when the `core` cluster becomes partitioned (for example when a core node leaves the cluster).
  Previously, the replicant nodes were unable to rebalance connections to the core nodes, until the core cluster became whole again.
  This was indicated by the error messages: `[error] line: 182, mfa: mria_lb:list_core_nodes/1, msg: mria_lb_core_discovery divergent cluster`.

  * The environment varialbe `SSL_DIST_OPTFILE` was not set correctly for non-boot commands.
  * When cookie is overridden from environment variable, EMQX node is unable to start.

- [#10044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10044) Fix node information formatter for stopped nodes in the cluster.
