# v5.0.16

## Enhancements



## Bug fixes

- [#9824](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9824) The `topics/{topic}` API endpoint would return `500 - Internal Error` if a topic had multiple routes. This is fixed by returning a list of routes.

- [#9832](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9832) Improve error log when bridge in 'sync' mode timed out to get response.

- [#9834](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9834) Allow `mqtt.idle_timeout` to be set to `infinity`

- [#9839](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9839) Make sure that the content of an Authorization header that users have specified for a webhook bridge is not printed to log files.

- [#9884](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9884) Do not resume all buffer workers on successful health check of any individual resource.
  Previously after any successful healthcheck, all buffer workers (for all resources) were resumed
