# e6.0.0-M2.202508

## Enhancements

- [#15628](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15628) Remove HStreamDB data integration.

- [#15463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15463) Durable storage RAM usage and storage efficiency optimizations.

  1. Added the following configuration parameters for the durable storage:

  - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.write_buffer_size`: RocksDB memtable size per shard.
  - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.cache_size`: RocksDB block size per shard.
  - `durable_storage.messages.rocksdb.max_open_files`: Limits the number of file descriptors used by RocksDB per shard.
  - `durable_storage.messages.layout.wildcard_thresholds`: Allows to tune wildcard thresholds for the `wildcard_optimized_v2` storage layout

  2. The default `serialization_schema` for the messages has been changed to `asn1`.

- [#15484](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15484) Changed our build system so that all packages are build with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)'s [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html), so that all now ship with Elixir support.  This opens up EMQX to Elixir community and allows us to use Elixir dependencies when required, besides enabling use of [IEx](https://hexdocs.pm/iex/IEx.html) as a better EMQX console.

- [#15525](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15525) Now, when attempting to remove an Internal Schema which is being referenced by either a Schema Validation or a Message Transformation, the removal will be denied.

- [#15542](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15542) Upgraded our `erlcoud` library to `3.8.3.0`.  This allows one to setup a S3 Connector without specifying Access Key Id and Secret Access Key, so long as the EC2 instance EMQX is running in has the correct IAM permissions to read/write to the configured bucket(s).

- [#15544](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15544) Add Arrow Flight SQL NIF driver support for Datalayers Integration.

- [#15556](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15556) Exposed maximum trace file size limit per each individual trace as a configuraion option `trace.max_file_size`.

- [#15583](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15583) Updated our `brod` client to version 4.4.4.  This expands the supported Kafka API ranges, in particular due to the `JoinGroups` API `v0`-`v1` being deprecated.

- [#15585](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15585) Updated our `brod` client to version 4.4.4. This expands the supported Kafka API ranges, in particular due to the `JoinGroups` API `v0`-`v1` being deprecated.

- [#15594](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15594) Exposed maximum number of traces allowed to exist in the cluster simultaneously as a configuration option `trace.max_traces`. This limit does not apply to node-local traces managed through `emqx ctl trace`.

  Optimized tracing implementation to eliminate potential atom leaks per created trace.

- [#15600](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15600) Added a new `cluster.description` configuration that allows one to add a description to the EMQX cluster.  This description can be changed via `PUT /cluster`, and viewed in the `GET /cluster` response.

- [#15621](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15621) Now, `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are optional fields for the S3Tables Connector.  If omitted, they'll be obtained from the Instance Metadata Service v2 APIs from the EC2 instance where EMQX is deployed.

- [#15631](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15631) A new API endpoint is added to list all models available for an AI provider.

- [#15635](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15635) Added new `key` and `tag` template fields for the RocketMQ Action which sets the message's key and tag, respectively.  Also, added a new `key_dispatch` value for the `strategy` field.

- [#15649](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15649) Added new Connectors and Actions that appends data to AWS AlloyDB, CockroachDB and AWS Redshift.

- [#15724](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15724) Introduce `openai_response` type for AI Completion Providers and completion profiles to use OpenAI's `response` API.

- [#15536](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15536) Disable the `node.global_gc_interval` configuration by default.

- [#15539](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15539) Optimize Erlang VM parameters.

  - Increase the buffer sizes for distributed channels to 32MB to avoid `busy_dist_port` alarms during intensive Mnesia operations: `+zdbbl 32768`
  - Disable scheduler busy-waiting to reduce CPU usage observed by the operating system: `+sbwt none +sbwtdcpu none +sbwtdio none`
  - Set scheduler binding type to `db` to reduce message latency: `+stbt db`

- [#15451](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15451) Introduce experimental `socket` backend for TCP listeners, designed to improve message processing latency and reduce compute resource usage. This can be enabled via the new `tcp_backend` listener option.

## Bug Fixes

- [#15383](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15383) Fix a potential resource leak in MQTT bridge when the bridge fails to start. Previously, the topic index table was not properly cleaned up when the bridge failed to start.

- [#15547](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15547) Fixed error when an HTTP request with a large body is sent.

- [#15489](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15489) Fix OIDC issuer scheme validation.

  The previously unsupported issuer URLs listed below are now supported.

  - `https://xxxxxxxx:8443/webman/sso/.well-known/openid-configuration`
  - `hostname`

- [#15553](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15553) Fixes an issue with helm chart when all nodes except one will be crashing if the chart is deployed with default values.

- [#15569](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15569) Fixed an issue where a Republish Rule Action could fail if the template for `direct_dispatch` was an empty string or resolve to a non-boolean value.  Now, if such situations occur, the default value, `false`, will be used.

- [#15580](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15580) Add emqxLicenseSecretRef variable to EMQX Enterprise helm chart, allowing users to specify a Kubernetes secret containing the EMQX license key. This fixes the issue with defunct emqxLicenseSecretName variable.

- [#15603](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15603) Fixed an issue with the MQTT bridge when a stale connection was displayed as `Connected' and the connection was not re-established.

- [#15647](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15647) Previously, if the user of a MongoDB Connector did not have sufficient privileges to perform `find` queries in a `foo` collection, it would be considered disconnected.  This has been fixed.

- [#15693](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15693) Postgres-based bridges were patched to avoid leaking connection pools.  Previously, depending on race conditions when initializing the pool, if one later deleted the Connector, the pool could still be present.

- [#15696](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15696) Support connection rate limiting for WebSocket (WS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS) listeners. Listener configuration options `max_conn_rate` and `max_conn_burst` are now respected: incoming connections going over specified connection rate are closed immediately after being accepted, mirroring TCP listener behavior.

  The `max_connections` option for WS/WSS listeners has also slightly changed: connections exceeding the limit are closed immediately after acceptance, _before_ any HTTP protocol exchange. Clients will now see an abrupt socket close instead of HTTP 429.

## Breaking Changes

- [#15613](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15613) Stopped releasing packages for Debian 10.

- [#15635](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15635) We no longer support setting key templates (and thus implicitly specifying key dispatch strategy) in the `parameters.strategy` field of RocketMQ Action.  Instead, users should set `parameters.strategy = key_dispatch` and specify the template in `parameters.key`.
