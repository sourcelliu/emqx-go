# v5.4.1

## Bug Fixes

- [#12234](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12234) Resolved compatibility issues with Open Telemetry configurations defined in `emqx.conf` from versions before EMQX 5.4.0, ensuring smooth integration of legacy configurations with the latest EMQX release.

- [#12236](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12236) Fixed client ID generation in MQTT broker data integration to comply with MQTT 3.1 specification of 23-byte limit. Client ID is now prefixed with user-assigned connector name, followed by the first 8 bytes of node name's SHA hash and pool member ID. If the resulting ID exceeds 23 bytes, additional SHA hash and truncation are applied to ensure compliance.

- [#12238](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12238) Resolved compatibility issue with the error format configurations introduced in the HTTP Action feature of EMQX version 5.3.2.

- [#12246](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12246) Stopped exposing port 11883 by default in Docker and removed it from Helm charts, as this port is no longer in use. 

- [#12249](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12249) Fixed an issue in the `/configs` API where attempting to modify a read-only configuration value resulted in a garbled response message.

- [#12264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12264) Fix rolling upgrade when replica nodes join cluster with core nodes prior to version 5.4.
