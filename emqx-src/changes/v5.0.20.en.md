# v5.0.20

## Enhancements

- [#10059](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10059) Errors returned by rule engine API are formatted in a more human readable way rather than dumping the raw error including the stacktrace.



## Bug Fixes

- [#10032](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10032) When resources on some nodes in the cluster are still in the 'initializing/connecting' state, the `bridges/` API will crash due to missing Metrics information for those resources. This fix will ignore resources that do not have Metrics information.

- [#10044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10044) Fix node information formatter for stopped nodes in the cluster. The bug was introduced by v5.0.18.

- [#10054](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10054) Fix the problem that the obfuscated password is used when using the `/bridges_probe` API to test the connection in Data-Bridge.

- [#10058](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10058) Deprecate unused QUIC TLS options.
  Only following TLS options are kept for the QUIC listeners:

  - cacertfile
  - certfile
  - keyfile
  - verify

- [#10076](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10076) Fix webhook bridge error handling: connection timeout should be a retriable error.
  Prior to this fix, connection timeout was classified as unrecoverable error and led to request being dropped.

- [#10078](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10078) Fix an issue that invalid QUIC listener setting could casue segfault.


- [#10084](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10084) Fix problem when joining core nodes running different EMQX versions into a cluster.
