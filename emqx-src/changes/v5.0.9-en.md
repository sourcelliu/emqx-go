# v5.0.9

## Enhancements

- Add `cert_common_name` and `cert_subject` placeholder support for authz_http and authz_mongo [#8973](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8973).

- Use milliseconds internally in emqx_delayed to store the publish time, improving precision [#9060](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9060).

- More rigorous checking of flapping to improve stability of the system [#9136](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9136).

- No message(s) echo for the message publish APIs [#9155](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9155).
  Prior to this fix, the message publish APIs (`api/v5/publish` and `api/v5/publish/bulk`) echos the message back to the client in HTTP body.
  This change fixed it to only send back the message ID.

## Bug fixes

- Check ACLs for last will testament topic before publishing the message [#8930](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8930).

- Fix GET /listeners API crash when some nodes (in a cluster) is still loading the configs [#9002](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9002).

- Fix empty variable interpolation in authentication and authorization [#8963](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8963).
  Placeholders for undefined variables are rendered now as empty strings and do not cause errors anymore.

- Fix the latency statistics error of the slow subscription stats [#8986](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8986).
  Prior to this change when `stats_type` is `internal` or `response`, the begin time stamp was taken at wrong precision.

- Fix shared subscription message re-dispatches [#9104](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9104).
  - When discarding QoS 2 inflight messages, there were excessive logs
  - For wildcard deliveries, the re-dispatch used the wrong topic (the publishing topic,
    but not the subscribing topic), caused messages to be lost when dispatching.

- Upgrade http client `gun` from 1.3.7 to [1.3.9](https://github.com/emqx/gun/tree/1.3.9)
  Prior to this fix, long-lived HTTPS connections for HTTP auth or webhook integrations
  may stall indefinitely, causing massive timeouts for HTTP requests.
