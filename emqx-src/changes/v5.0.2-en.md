# v5.0.2

Announcement: EMQX team has decided to stop supporting relup for opensource edition.
Going forward, it will be an enterprise-only feature.

Main reason: relup requires carefully crafted upgrade instructions from ALL previous versions.

For example, 4.3 is now at 4.3.16, we have `4.3.0->4.3.16`, `4.3.1->4.3.16`, ... 16 such upgrade paths in total to maintain.
This had been the biggest obstacle for EMQX team to act agile enough in delivering enhancements and fixes.

## Enhancements
