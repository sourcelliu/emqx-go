# v5.0.3

* Deleted `cluster_singleton` from MQTT bridge config document. This config is no longer applicable in 5.0 [#8407](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8407)
* Fix `emqx/emqx:latest` docker image publish to use the Erlang flavor, but not Elixir flavor [#8414](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8414)
* Changed the `exp` field in JWT auth to be optional rather than required to fix backwards compatability with 4.X releases. [#8425](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8425)

## Enhancements

* Improve the speed of dashboard's HTTP API routing rule generation, which sometimes causes timeout [#8438](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/8438)
