# e5.0.1

## Enhancements

- [#10019](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10019) Add low level tuning settings for QUIC listeners.

- [#10059](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10059) Errors returned by rule engine API are formatted in a more human readable way rather than dumping the raw error including the stacktrace.

- [#9213](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9213) Add pod disruption budget to helm chart

- [#9949](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9949) QUIC transport Multistreams support and QUIC TLS cacert support.


- [#9932](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9932) Integrate `TDengine` into `bridges` as a new backend.

- [#9967](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9967) New common TLS option 'hibernate_after' to reduce memory footprint per idle connecion, default: 5s.

## Bug Fixes

- [#10009](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10009) Validate `bytes` param to `GET /trace/:name/log` to not exceed signed 32bit integer.

- [#10015](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10015) To prevent errors caused by an incorrect EMQX node cookie provided from an environment variable,
  we have implemented a fail-fast mechanism.
  Previously, when an incorrect cookie was provided, the command would still attempt to ping the node,
  leading to the error message 'Node xxx not responding to pings'.
  With the new implementation, if a mismatched cookie is detected,
  a message will be logged to indicate that the cookie is incorrect,
  and the command will terminate with an error code of 1 without trying to ping the node.

- [#10020](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10020) Fix bridge metrics when running in async mode with batching enabled (`batch_size` > 1).

- [#10021](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10021) Fix error message when the target node of `emqx_ctl cluster join` command is not running.

- [#10032](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10032) When resources on some nodes in the cluster are still in the 'initializing/connecting' state, the `bridges/` API will crash due to missing Metrics information for those resources. This fix will ignore resources that do not have Metrics information.

- [#10037](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10037) Fix Swagger API doc rendering crash.
  In version 5.0.18, a bug was introduced that resulted in duplicated field names in the configuration schema. This, in turn, caused the Swagger schema generated to become invalid.

- [#10041](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10041) For influxdb bridge, added integer value placeholder annotation hint to `write_syntax` documentation.
  Also supported setting a constant value for the `timestamp` field.

- [#10042](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10042) Improve behavior of the `replicant` nodes when the `core` cluster becomes partitioned (for example when a core node leaves the cluster).
  Previously, the replicant nodes were unable to rebalance connections to the core nodes, until the core cluster became whole again.
  This was indicated by the error messages: `[error] line: 182, mfa: mria_lb:list_core_nodes/1, msg: mria_lb_core_discovery divergent cluster`.

- [#10043](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10043) Fixed two bugs introduced in v5.0.18.
  * The environment varialbe `SSL_DIST_OPTFILE` was not set correctly for non-boot commands.
  * When cookie is overridden from environment variable, EMQX node is unable to start.

- [#10044](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10044) Fix node information formatter for stopped nodes in the cluster. The bug was introduced by v5.0.18.

- [#10054](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10054) Fix the problem that the obfuscated password is used when using the `/bridges_probe` API to test the connection in Data-Bridge.

- [#10058](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10058) Deprecate unused QUIC TLS options.
  Only following TLS options are kept for the QUIC listeners:

  - cacertfile
  - certfile
  - keyfile
  - verify

- [#10076](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10076) Fix webhook bridge error handling: connection timeout should be a retriable error.
  Prior to this fix, connection timeout was classified as unrecoverable error and led to request being dropped.

- [#10078](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10078) Fix an issue that invalid QUIC listener setting could casue segfault.


- [#10084](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10084) Fix problem when joining core nodes running different EMQX versions into a cluster.

  [Mria PR](https://github.com/emqx/mria/pull/127)

- [#10086](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10086) Upgrade HTTP client ehttpc to `0.4.7`.
  Prior to this upgrade, HTTP clients for authentication, authorization and webhook may crash
  if `body` is empty but content-type HTTP header is set.
  For more details see [ehttpc PR#44](https://github.com/emqx/ehttpc/pull/44).

- [#9939](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9939) Allow 'emqx ctl cluster' command to be issued before Mnesia starts.
  Prior to this change, EMQX `replicant` could not use `manual` discovery strategy.
  Now it's possible to join cluster using 'manual' strategy.

- [#9958](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9958) Fix bad http response format when client ID is not found in `clients` APIs

- [#9961](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9961) Avoid parsing config files for node name and cookie when executing non-boot commands in bin/emqx.

- [#9974](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9974) Report memory usage to statsd and prometheus using the same data source as dashboard.
  Prior to this fix, the memory usage data source was collected from an outdated source which did not work well in containers.

- [#9978](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9978) Fixed configuration issue when choosing to use SSL for a Postgres connection (`authn`, `authz` and bridge).
  The connection could fail to complete with a previously working configuration after an upgrade from 5.0.13 to newer EMQX versions.

- [#9997](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9997) Fix Swagger API schema generation. `deprecated` metadata field is now always boolean, as [Swagger specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) suggests.

- [#10007](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10007) Change Kafka bridge's config `memory_overload_protection` default value from `true` to `false`.
  EMQX logs cases when messages get dropped due to overload protection, and this is also reflected in counters.
  However, since there is by default no alerting based on the logs and counters,
  setting it to `true` may cause messages being dropped without noticing.
  At the time being, the better option is to let sysadmin set it explicitly so they are fully aware of the benefits and risks.

- [#10087](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/10087) Use default template `${timestamp}` if the `timestamp` config is empty (undefined) when inserting data in InfluxDB.
  Prior to this change, InfluxDB bridge inserted a wrong timestamp when template is not provided.
