## Bug fixes

- [#9864](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9864) Fix the exclusive topics aren't removed when the session has already been cleaned.

- [#9875](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9875) Return `400` if a broken plugin package is uploaded from HTTP API, also cleanup if plugin is not accepted.

- [#9916](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9916) Fix MQTT bridge fails to verify TLS wildcard server certificate.


- [#9922](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9922) Fix the issue with the bridge resource buffer where it might become stuck if enough async queries fill the inflight window full before failing with retryable errors.

- [#9923](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9923) Fix REPORT_CB/2 CRASH error logs when errors happen during boot-up or shutdown.

- [#9938](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9938) Report some egress MQTT bridge errors as recoverable, and thus retryable.

- [#9946](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9946) Add back `reconnect_interval` as deprecated field for MQTT bridge.
  The field was removed from v5.0.16/e5.0.0 by mistake, caused new version unable to start on old config.
  Now it's added back as deprecated (config value is ignored if provided).

- [#9951](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9951) Propagate errors from operations (`start|stop|restart`) on bridges API if called for all nodes.

- [#9952](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/9952) Disallow subscribing with QoS 2 for ingress MQTT bridges.
  Allow user to configure `clean_start` option for ingress MQTT bridges, however.
