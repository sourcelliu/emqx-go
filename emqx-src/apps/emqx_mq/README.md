# MQTT Message Queue

The application provides Message Queue functionality for EMQX.

## Overview

A Message Queue is a collection of messages with the following properties:

- Message Queue is identified by `topic/filter` from the user's perspective.
- Has an explicit lifecycle.
- Is automatically replenished with published messages matched with the topic filter during the queue's lifetime.
- Clients may subscribe to the queue's `$q/topic/filter` to consume messages from the queue cooperatively.
- A Queue is capped by time or size.
- A Queue is not strictly ordered.A queue may have "Last-Value" semantics. When enabled,
  - A queue has a _key expression_ to extract a key from each message.
  - Messages overwrite previous messages with the same key.

## Internal Implementation

Message Queue is designed to have little interaction with other parts of EMQX.
Message Queue application
* Uses Durable Storage to store messages and queue state.
* Uses Mnesia table to maintain message queue index.
* Is integrated via hooks into the EMQX core.

The major components are:
* Local subscription registry ([emqx_mq_sub_registry.erl](./src/emqx_mq_sub_registry.erl), [emqx_mq_sub.erl](./src/emqx_mq_sub.erl), [emqx_mq_sub_buffer.erl](./src/emqx_mq_sub_buffer.erl)). These are data structures
facilitating channel's connections to the Message Queues. They are stored in the process dictionary of the channel.
* Message Queue registry ([emqx_mq_registry.erl](./src/emqx_mq_registry.erl)). This is a registry responsible for keeping track of the Message Queues: creating, updating, deleting, and looking up.
* Message Queue state storage ([emqx_mq_state_storage.erl](./src/emqx_mq_state_storage.erl)). This is a storage layer responsible for storing the Message Queue metadata and state of consumption.
* Message Queue message database ([emqx_mq_message_db.erl](./src/emqx_mq_message_db.erl)). This is a storage layer responsible for storing the Message Queue messages.
* Message Queue Consumer. This is a component responsible for consuming messages from the Message Queue and dispatching them to the channels.

## Data Flow

### Publishing

* A client publishes a message to `some/topic`.
* An MQ hook is triggered to handle the message publication.
* The hook looks up in the MQ registry if there are any Message Queues whose topic filter matches the message topic.
* If yes, the hook writes the message to the corresponding Message Queues.

### Subscribing/Consuming

* A client subscribes to some topic.
* An MQ hook is triggered to handle the subscription.
* If the topic is a Message Queue topic (`$q/some/topic`), the hook initializes a subscription in the Channel's state and
initiates a connection to the Message Queue Consumer.
* If a Consumer is not yet found, a new consumer is started.
* The Consumer restores message consumption progress and starts to fetch data from the Message Queue message database.
* The Consumer dispatches received messages to the connected subscribers.
* The subscribers (channels) deliver MQ messages to the clients.

### Schematic View

The following diagram shows the data flow between the Message Queue components:

# Configuration

The Message Queues are configured via the `mq` section of the configuration file.

```hocon
mq {
    ## The interval at which the Message Queues will clean up expired messages.
    gc_interval = 1h
    ## The maximum retention period of messages in regular Message Queues.
    regular_queue_retention_period = 1d
    ## The interval at which subscribers will retry to find a queue if the queue is not found
    ## when subscribing to a queue topic.
    find_queue_retry_interval = 10s
}

durable_storage {
    ## Settings for the database storing the Message Queue state.
    ## See Durable Storage configuration for more details.
    mq_states {
        transaction {
            flush_interval = 10
            idle_flush_interval = 5
            conflict_window = 5000
        }
    }
    ## Settings for the database storing the Message Queue messages.
    ## See Durable Storage configuration for more details.
    mq_messages {
        transaction {
            flush_interval = 100
            idle_flush_interval = 20
            conflict_window = 5000
        }
    }
}
```

# HTTP APIs

Message queue management APIs are provided for creating, updating, looking up, deleting, and listing message queues.

Create Message Queue:

```bash
curl -s -u key:secret -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:18083/api/v5/message_queues/queues -d '{"topic_filter": "t1/#", "is_lastvalue": false}' | jq
{
  ...
  "topic_filter": "t1/#"
}
```

List message queues:

```bash
curl -s -u key:secret -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:18083/api/v5/message_queues/queues | jq
{
  "data": [
    {
      ...
      "topic_filter": "t1/#"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "hasnext": false
  }
}
```

Update Message Queue:
